My personal blocklist for Pihole [ Updated weekly ]


INFORMATION ABOUT LISTS:

There will be 2 folders with varying lists:

        AdlistG - This is my personal Adlist, and also the most stable in terms of false positives
        AdlistMulti - This is an adlist i will maintain, however as i do not run this myself, there will be a *few* false positives
        
  How do i report a false positive:
  
        You can report a false positive by either:
          1. Opening an 'issue' request with any websites or services you think should not be blocked
          2. By emailing me at: [COMING SOON]
          3. Dropping me a message on discord: Adam20054#0001
          
          Please use this format for any issues so i can resolve them easier:
            
            Issue:
            Sites [full link and/or serice name]:
            Any aditional information: 
            
            
I have a list i use that i would like to add to this list for everyone to use, how can i do this?

        You can do this by contacting me via my Discord or email [see above paragraph] with the list and what it blocks, i will then look at the
        list to make sure it does not have any false positives before adding it.
        
        
 
 
 
 Any list is free to use, i just ask that you give credit where credit is due :)
